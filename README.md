# Coding test for Ember

Tested with Flutter 3.29.0 on Android

This was a really fun take home challenge! I have provided a basic working solution, however unfortunately I won't have the time over the next few days to refine and improve the parts that I would have liked to (mainly concerning making the view more useful to passengers!) In total I estimate to have spent around 7 hours on this task. PLease don't be put off by the fact I didn't get in touch to ask questions or discuss my solution, it's just not the best week to fit in work in the evenings and I didn't want to waste time. I decided to use OpenStreetMap as it's what you guys are using on the web. I hope this solution demonstrates solid app development experience, is easy to understand, and can give us plenty to discuss in future.
